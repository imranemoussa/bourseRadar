J''ai créé un guide complet avec toutes les commandes nécessaires pour ton projet.
Voici l''ordre d''exécution recommandé :

Créer la structure (Étape 1)
Backend Rails (Étape 2) - Installer Rails et les gems
Frontend Vite (Étape 3) - Créer l''app React avec TypeScript
Configuration des fichiers (Étape 4) - Routes, CORS, Tailwind, etc.
Créer les dossiers (Étape 5) - Structure organisée
Base de données (Étape 6) - Migrations et données de test
Lancer les serveurs (Étape 7) - Tester que tout fonctionne

Points importants :

Le backend tournera sur http://localhost:3001
Le frontend sur http://localhost:3000 (ou 5173 avec Vite)
Les proxy sont configurés pour la communication entre les deux
Les données de test seront créées automatiquement

Commence par exécuter les commandes de l''Étape 1, puis dis-moi où tu en es !

Frontend Vite (Étape 3) - Créer l''app React avec TypeScript
Configuration des fichiers (Étape 4) - Routes, CORS, Tailwind, etc.
Créer les dossiers (Étape 5) - Structure organisée
Base de données (Étape 6) - Migrations et données de test
Lancer les serveurs (Étape 7) - Tester que tout fonctionne

Points importants :

Le backend tournera sur http://localhost:3001
Le frontend sur http://localhost:3000 (ou 5173 avec Vite)
Les proxy sont configurés pour la communication entre les deux
